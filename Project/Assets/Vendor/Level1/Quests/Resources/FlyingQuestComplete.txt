1=You know, I hear wizards are even more powerful when they have a staff. I just happen to have one here, but I'm obviously not magical enough to use it so...I'd like to give it to you.

3=Now that you're an advanced wizard, you'll find new, more powerful spells in your Spell Book! Congratulations!
